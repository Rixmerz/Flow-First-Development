  # Flow First Development (FFD)
</div>

**Flow First Development (FFD)** is a project development methodology focused on building software in **strict sequential flow**, ensuring that **each step is functional and validated before moving to the next**.

Unlike iterative models that may jump between tasks, FFD prioritizes **dependency-driven progress**, guaranteeing that the **critical path** of the user flow is operational from day one.

---

## 🚀 Why FFD?
Modern software teams often waste time building features out of order.
FFD ensures:
- **Predictable progress** — no blocked features waiting on others.
- **Early usable product** — even if incomplete.
- **Dependency clarity** — you always know *what comes next*.
- **Ideal for AI-assisted development** — perfect for guiding AI tools step-by-step.

---

## 🔹 Core Principles
1. **Flow First** — always build in the order the user will experience it.
2. **Critical Path Focus** — skip secondary features until the main flow is complete.
3. **Sequential + Hierarchical** — handle nested flows in priority order.
4. **Milestone Validation** — every stage is user-validated before moving forward.

---

## 📊 Example
For a platform with:
- **Landing**
- **Login**
- **Admin Panel**
- **Client Panel**

FFD dictates:
1. Landing Page → 2. Login → 3. Admin Panel → 4. Client Panel.

The **Client Panel** depends on Admin data, so the Admin Panel must be ready first.
