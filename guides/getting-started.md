# Getting Started with Flow First Development

A step-by-step guide to implement FFD in your next project.

## ðŸŽ¯ Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:
- **Project scope**: Clear understanding of what you're building
- **Stakeholder access**: Ability to get user/business feedback
- **Team alignment**: Development team committed to sequential approach
- **Time flexibility**: Willingness to adjust timeline based on learnings

## ðŸ“‹ Step 1: Map Your User Flow

### 1.1 Identify Your Primary User
Choose the **most important user** for your MVP:
- Who generates the most business value?
- Who has the simplest, most common workflow?
- Who would you demonstrate the product to first?

**Example**: For an e-commerce platform, choose "customer buying a product" over "admin managing inventory."

### 1.2 Document the Happy Path
Write out each step your primary user takes:

```
User Flow Example - E-commerce Customer:
1. Lands on homepage
2. Searches for product
3. Views product details  
4. Adds to cart
5. Proceeds to checkout
6. Enters payment info
7. Confirms order
8. Receives confirmation
```

### 1.3 Validate the Flow
- **Walk through it yourself**: Can you complete each step?
- **Ask a user**: Would they follow these exact steps?
- **Check business rules**: Does this flow meet business requirements?

## ðŸ”— Step 2: Identify Dependencies

### 2.1 Technical Dependencies
For each step, ask: "What must exist for this step to work?"

```
Step 3: View product details
Dependencies:
- Product database with sample data
- Product detail page template
- Image storage and display
- Basic navigation from search results
```

### 2.2 Business Dependencies
- **Data requirements**: What data is needed?
- **External integrations**: Payment providers, APIs, etc.
- **Approval processes**: What needs stakeholder sign-off?

### 2.3 Create Dependency Map

```
Step 1 (Homepage) 
  â†“ 
Step 2 (Search) - requires: product database
  â†“
Step 3 (Product Details) - requires: step 2 + images
  â†“
Step 4 (Add to Cart) - requires: step 3 + session management
  â†“
Step 5 (Checkout) - requires: step 4 + user accounts
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Step 3: Define Milestones

### 3.1 Milestone Criteria
Each milestone must be:
- **User-testable**: A real user can interact with it
- **Functionally complete**: No broken or half-finished features
- **Sequential**: Builds on the previous milestone
- **Demonstrable**: You can show progress to stakeholders

### 3.2 Milestone Sizing
**Good milestone size**: 1-3 weeks for most teams
- Large enough to deliver real value
- Small enough to get frequent feedback
- Sized for your team's capacity

### 3.3 Example Milestone Breakdown

```
Milestone 1: Basic Product Discovery (Week 1-2)
- Homepage with real product data
- Basic search functionality
- Product listing page
- User can browse and find products

Milestone 2: Product Interaction (Week 3-4)  
- Product detail pages
- Image galleries
- Basic product information
- User can evaluate specific products

Milestone 3: Purchase Intent (Week 5-6)
- Shopping cart functionality
- Add/remove items
- Cart persistence
- User can collect desired items

Milestone 4: Transaction Completion (Week 7-8)
- Checkout process
- Payment integration
- Order confirmation
- User can complete purchases
```

## ðŸš€ Step 4: Start Building

### 4.1 Focus on Milestone 1 Only
- **Don't plan ahead**: Don't design milestone 3 while building milestone 1
- **Use real data**: Avoid mock data whenever possible  
- **Build end-to-end**: Complete the user journey for milestone 1
- **No shortcuts**: Build it properly, don't hack together temporary solutions

### 4.2 Development Best Practices

**Start Simple**:
```javascript
// Good: Simple but real implementation
function searchProducts(query) {
  return products.filter(p => 
    p.name.toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase())
  );
}

// Avoid: Complex search that you don't need yet
function searchProducts(query) {
  // Don't build elasticsearch integration until you need it
}
```

**Build for Current Milestone**:
- Don't add features "because we'll need them later"
- Don't over-engineer for future scalability
- Focus on making current milestone excellent

### 4.3 Testing Strategy
- **Manual testing**: Walk through the user flow yourself
- **User testing**: Get real users to try the milestone
- **Automated testing**: Test the completed user journey
- **Performance testing**: Ensure acceptable speed for current load

## âœ… Step 5: Validate Before Moving On

### 5.1 Validation Checklist
Before starting the next milestone:

- [ ] **Functionality**: All features work as intended
- [ ] **User testing**: Real users can complete the flow successfully  
- [ ] **Performance**: Response times meet requirements
- [ ] **Business rules**: All requirements satisfied
- [ ] **Technical quality**: Code is maintainable and documented
- [ ] **Stakeholder approval**: Business stakeholders accept the milestone

### 5.2 Getting User Feedback

**Quick validation methods**:
- **5-minute user tests**: Watch someone use your milestone
- **Demo sessions**: Show the milestone to stakeholders
- **Analytics review**: Check usage patterns if you have users
- **Bug reports**: Identify any issues before proceeding

### 5.3 What If Validation Fails?

**Don't move to the next milestone**. Instead:
1. **Identify the issues**: What specifically doesn't work?
2. **Fix the problems**: Address all critical issues
3. **Re-test**: Validate again with the same criteria
4. **Learn and adjust**: Apply lessons to future milestone planning

## ðŸ”„ Step 6: Iterate and Improve

### 6.1 Plan Next Milestone
Only after milestone 1 is validated:
- Review user feedback and adjust plans
- Map dependencies for milestone 2
- Apply lessons learned to improve planning
- Adjust timeline if needed

### 6.2 Continuous Improvement
Track these metrics across milestones:
- **Time to complete**: Are estimates improving?
- **User satisfaction**: Are users happier with each milestone?
- **Rework percentage**: How much previous work needs changing?
- **Dependency accuracy**: How well did you predict blockers?

### Development Tools
FFD works with any tech stack:
- **Version control**: Tag releases at each milestone
- **CI/CD**: Deploy each milestone to staging
- **Testing**: Build test suites incrementally
- **Documentation**: Document as you build

## ðŸš¨ Common Beginner Mistakes

### 1. Planning Too Far Ahead
**Mistake**: Designing all 5 milestones in detail upfront
**Solution**: Plan milestone 1 in detail, milestone 2 roughly, milestone 3+ as high-level goals

### 2. Building "Infrastructure First"  
**Mistake**: Starting with admin panels, APIs, or database schemas
**Solution**: Start with the user-facing experience, build infrastructure as needed

### 3. Skipping Validation
**Mistake**: Moving to milestone 2 because milestone 1 "mostly works"
**Solution**: Strict validation gatesâ€”never move forward with known issues

### 4. Scope Creep During Milestones
**Mistake**: Adding "small features" to current milestone
**Solution**: Strict scope controlâ€”defer all additions to future milestones

### 5. Mock Data Development
**Mistake**: Building UI with fake data, planning to "connect real data later"
**Solution**: Use real data from day 1, even if it's minimal

## ðŸ“ˆ Success Indicators

You'll know FFD is working when:
- **Predictable progress**: Each milestone delivers when promised
- **User engagement**: Users can actually use and test your product early
- **Clear priorities**: Everyone knows what's being built next
- **Reduced integration issues**: Features work together because they're built sequentially
- **Stakeholder confidence**: Business stakeholders see consistent progress

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **Choose a project**: Start with something small and low-risk
2. **Map the flow**: Spend time getting the user journey right
3. **Define milestone 1**: Make it small but valuable
4. **Start building**: Focus only on milestone 1
5. **Get feedback**: Validate before moving forward
