# Implementation Guide

## Step 1: Map the Full User Flow
Document each step the user will take, in exact order.

## Step 2: Identify Dependencies
Mark which steps depend on previous ones.

## Step 3: Define Milestones
Each milestone is a fully functional segment of the flow.

## Step 4: Validate Before Moving On
Never start a milestone without confirming the previous one is accepted.

## Step 5: Adjust and Iterate
If a change affects earlier milestones, revisit and revalidate them.
