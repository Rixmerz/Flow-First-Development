## üì± Case Study 4: Mobile App with Backend API

**Project**: Fitness tracking app with social features  
**Timeline**: 5 months  
**Team**: 4 mobile developers, 3 backend developers

### API-First Flow Design

**Critical Path Analysis**:
- Mobile app depends on API endpoints
- Social features depend on user data being stable
- Analytics depend on user activity patterns

**Coordinated Development Flow**:
1. User Registration API + Mobile Auth
2. Basic Activity Tracking API + Mobile UI
3. Data Persistence + Mobile Offline Support
4. User Profiles API + Mobile Profile Screen
5. Social Connections API + Mobile Friend Features
6. Activity Sharing API + Mobile Social Feed
7. Analytics API + Mobile Stats Dashboard

**Cross-Platform Coordination**:
- Backend and mobile teams worked on same milestone simultaneously
- API spec completed before mobile implementation started
- Each milestone had working end-to-end functionality
- No "API ready but mobile not" or vice versa situations

**Results**:
- 40% fewer integration bugs
- Consistent progress across both teams
- Early user testing possible from Milestone 2
- Smooth feature releases every 3 weeks

## üí° Implementation Takeaways

1. **Start Simple**: Even complex projects benefit from simple first milestones
2. **Real Data Early**: Use actual data as soon as possible, not mock data
3. **User Journey Focus**: Technical architecture follows user flow, not the reverse
4. **Cross-Team Coordination**: FFD works best when all teams follow the same flow
5. **Validation Gates**: Each milestone must be user-validated before proceeding

These case studies demonstrate FFD's versatility across domains while maintaining core principles of sequential development and dependency awareness.
