# Introduction to Flow First Development (FFD)

Flow First Development (FFD) is a methodology designed to ensure that software is built in a **strict sequence**, mirroring the order in which end-users will experience it.

### Goals:
- Deliver **usable** product increments earlier.
- Maintain **clear dependency chains**.
- Reduce wasted effort on out-of-sequence work.
