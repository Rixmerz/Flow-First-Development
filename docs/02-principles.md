# Flow First Development â€” Principles

1. **Strict Sequential Order**
   - Tasks follow the exact order of the end-user flow.
   - No jumping ahead to secondary features.

2. **Dependency Awareness**
   - Identify all technical dependencies before coding.
   - Ensure no feature is built without its prerequisites.

3. **Hierarchical Flow Handling**
   - Nested flows are resolved in order of importance.
   - Example: Admin > Client > Secondary Panels.

4. **Milestone Validation**
   - Every step ends with validation from stakeholders or end-users.
