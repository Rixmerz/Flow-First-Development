# Project Brief â€” [Project Name]

## Project Overview
**Project Name**: [Full project name]  
**Project Type**: [Web app, Mobile app, API, etc.]  
**Timeline**: [Expected duration]  
**Team Size**: [Number of developers, designers, etc.]

## Business Context
**Problem Statement**: [What problem are we solving?]  
**Target Users**: [Who will use this product?]  
**Business Goals**: [Key business outcomes expected]  
**Success Metrics**: [How will we measure success?]

## User Flow Definition

### Primary User
**User Type**: [Customer, Admin, Manager, etc.]  
**User Goal**: [What do they want to accomplish?]  
**User Context**: [When/where will they use this?]

### Core User Journey
Document the main flow your primary user will follow:

1. **Step 1**: [First action user takes]
2. **Step 2**: [Next logical step]
3. **Step 3**: [Continues...]
4. **Step 4**: [And so on...]
5. **Step 5**: [Final outcome]

### Secondary Flows
- **Flow A**: [Alternative user path]
- **Flow B**: [Admin/management flow]
- **Flow C**: [Error/edge case handling]

## FFD Milestone Planning

### Milestone Breakdown
Based on the core user journey, define initial milestones:

**Milestone 1**: [User capability #1]
- **Duration**: [Weeks]
- **User Story**: As a [user], I want to [capability] so that [value]
- **Dependencies**: [What must exist first]
- **Validation**: [How we'll test with users]

**Milestone 2**: [User capability #2]  
- **Duration**: [Weeks]
- **User Story**: As a [user], I want to [capability] so that [value]
- **Dependencies**: [Requires Milestone 1 + additional items]
- **Validation**: [How we'll test with users]

**Milestone 3**: [User capability #3]
- **Duration**: [Weeks]
- **User Story**: As a [user], I want to [capability] so that [value]
- **Dependencies**: [Requires Milestone 2 + additional items]
- **Validation**: [How we'll test with users]

### Milestone Sequencing Rules
- [ ] Each milestone delivers a complete user capability
- [ ] Each milestone can be tested independently by real users
- [ ] Each milestone builds on previous milestones
- [ ] No milestone should take longer than 3 weeks
- [ ] Dependencies are clearly identified and achievable

## Technical Considerations

### Technology Stack
**Frontend**: [React, Vue, Angular, etc.]  
**Backend**: [Node.js, Python, .NET, etc.]  
**Database**: [PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.]  
**Infrastructure**: [AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.]

### Key Technical Dependencies
- **External APIs**: [Payment, email, maps, etc.]
- **Third-party Services**: [Analytics, monitoring, etc.]
- **Infrastructure Requirements**: [Hosting, CDN, etc.]
- **Security Requirements**: [Auth, encryption, compliance]

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| [Technical challenge] | [High/Medium/Low] | [How to address] |
| [Integration complexity] | [High/Medium/Low] | [How to address] |
| [Performance concerns] | [High/Medium/Low] | [How to address] |
